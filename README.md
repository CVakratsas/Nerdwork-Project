# Nerdwork
This repository hosts the project NerdWork, which consists of the necessary documents for its creation and the code that implements its functionality. Its innovative functionality is the result of the overall effort of ten (10) college students at the University of Macedonia in the department of Applied Informatics - Computer Science and Technology. Their knowledge is mostly limited to the skills they acquired from the department’s curriculum, up to the third semester.
# Functionality
NerdWork is an attempt to automate the management of appointments between students and professors while it provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) which allows the process of rating the department's courses and professors.
# Installation and Execution
## Via Eclipse IDE
To properly install and execute the software via the Eclipse IDE you **must** follow the steps in the [User Manual](https://github.com/Nerdwork-Team/Nerdwork-Project/blob/master/User_Manual.pdf).
## Via Command Line
In order to execute the software via command line you **must** execute:
**java -jar --module-path "path/to/javafx/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml file_name.jar**
# Technologies Used
The software was developed using the programming languages Java and PHP, while some members of the team studied the library JavaFX to develop the user’s interface. Alongside we established a database server to make sure the software can function correctly in actual “real world” conditions.
# Motivation
The reason for our collaboration was an assignment on the course Software Engineering, however the reason it continued smoothly was the fact that we shared a common goal to develop a system that could help a fellow student of our department with some standardized procedures.
# Assumptions
In the limited time, that of a semester, in which we had to complete the software, we were forced to make some necessary assumptions and define some limitations. In addition to the limitations already presented in the documents, we should mention that we also narrowed the capabilities of our application. For instance, we rejected suggestions such as the calculation of the grade a student could get in a selected course, given their grades on other courses and the data of a more complex and detailed rating of the course and its lecturer.
