# Nerdwork
This repository hosts the project NerdWork, which consists of the necessary documents for its creation and the code that implements its functionality.This innovative idea is the result of the overall effort of ten (10) college students at University of Macedonia in the department of Applied Informatics. Their knowledge is mostly limited to the information and skills the department’s curriculum has to offer, up to the third semester.
# Main Idea
NerdWork is an attempt to automate the management of appointments between students and professors. Furthermore, it provides a user-friendly interface to a platform to rate the department’s courses and professors.
# Technologies Used
The software was developed using the programming languages Java and PHP, while some members of the team learned the library JavaFX to implement the user’s interface. Alongside we established a database server to make sure the software can function correctly in actual conditions.
# Motivation
The reason for our collaboration was an assignment on the course Software Engineering, however the reason it continued smoothly was the fact that we shared a common goal to develop a system that could actually help a fellow student of our department.
# Assumptions
The limited time, that of a semester, we had to complete the software, forced us to make some assumptions and define some limitations. In addition to the limitations presented in the documents, we should mention that we also narrowed the capabilities of our application. For instance, we rejected suggestions such as the calculation of the grade a student could get in a selected course, given their grades on other courses and the data of a more complex and detailed rating of the course and its lecturer.
